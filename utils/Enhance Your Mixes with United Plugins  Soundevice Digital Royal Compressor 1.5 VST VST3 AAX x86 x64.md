It has a very natural and organic sound that enhances any source without sounding harsh or artificial. The three models offer different flavors of compression that suit different genres and styles. The saturation mode adds some extra spice and character to the sound. The AGC mode is a lifesaver when dealing with inconsistent levels. The plugin is very CPU-friendly and stable.
